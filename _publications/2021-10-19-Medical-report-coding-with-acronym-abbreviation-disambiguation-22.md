Techniques for coding a medical report include identifying an acronym or abbreviation in the medical report, and a plurality of phrases not explicitly included in the
medical report that are possible expanded forms of the acronym or abbreviation in the medical report. From the plurality of phrases, a most likely expanded form of the
acronym or abbreviation may be selected by applying to the medical report a statistical acronym/abbreviation expansion model trained on a corpus of medical reports. By
applying to the medical report with the expanded acronym or abbreviation one or more statistical fact extraction models, a clinical fact may be extracted from the medical
report based at least in part on the most likely expanded form of the acronym or abbreviation in the medical report, and a corresponding medical taxonomy code may be
assigned to the extracted clinical fact from the medical report.
