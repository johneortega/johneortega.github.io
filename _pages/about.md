More about me
======
Coming soon!
I teach a course at Columbia University on data analytics and natural language understanding, my [Columbia profile](https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/john-ortega) is online.
At this point, I don't have time to teach more classes but would love to some day.


I defended my doctoral thesis on fuzzy-match repair with international mention in Alicante, Spain. You can view my [thesis] (https://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/116315)
online and feel free to direct any questions that you may have via one of my social channels listed below. You can also email me at jortega at cs.nyu.edu.


I am an avid pursuer of solving the low-resource translation problem
