Welcome to my website on GitHub. My GitHub user is johneortega. I consider myself a computational linguist and business person with skills ranging from deep learning
research on low-resource languages to developing small businesses from the ground up. I am currently an applied researcher and manager with research interests in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, machine translation, and health care. I also serve as a computer science instructor and researcher at Columbia and New York Universities. I have started and exited two companies and actively advise on technical issues as well as worked as a contract senior architect and software developer for companies such as WebMD, Clear Channel (IHeart Radio), Creative Virtual, Buongiorno, and others. I possess more than 15 years of overall software, system, sales, and marketing experience. In addition to industry knowledge, I have deep academic knowledge and have published many works both for IP and academic purposes.

More about me
======
I teach a course at Columbia University on data analytics and natural language understanding, my [Columbia profile](https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/john-ortega) is online.
At this point, I don't have time to teach more classes but would love to some day.
I defended my doctoral thesis on fuzzy-match repair with international mention in Alicante, Spain. You can view my [thesis] (https://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/116315)
online and feel free to direct any questions that you may have via one of my social channels listed below. You can also email me at jortega at cs.nyu.edu.
I am an avid pursuer of solving the low-resource translation problem, here are some thoughts of on a Peruvian low-resource language called [Quechua](https://medium.com/@johneortega/low-resource-languages-for-machine-translation-a-governmental-problem-7e014581d719).

Research and teaching
======
My research focuses on the role of linguistics, knowledge, and theory in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), sub-fields of artificial intelligence
(AI). More specifically, recent work focuses on translation, prediction, deep learning, topic modeling, information retrieval, and Bayesian statistics. Within those broad
fields, I have focused on two major sub-fields. First, the process of automatically translating documents through a digital method called machine translation (MT). Second,
the use of computer-assisted methods to help digital tool users become more productive. Two major categories of digital tools have been primary in my research: (1)
computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools in the localization sector and (2) computer-assisted coding (CAC) tools in the medical sector. Additionally, before research on MT
and computer-assisted methods, the focus was on increasing software efficiency in a broad sense, typically dealing with with databases, online software, and big-data.

Details of my research are available in my CV and publication list. Academic resources and computer programs that I have worked on are available, in some cases,
as open-source programs and, in other cases, as full-fledged systems for private enterprises through licensing. I am the author of several patents and publications in the AI
field and have worked on research both in academia and the private sector. 

On the teaching front, I believe that, after having spent a few years in classrooms at Columbia, NYU, and Rutgers, I've been able to assess and pivot my teaching style to one that helps everyone learn. I also think that the perseverance it takes to go back and complete a PhD after 15 years in the private sector separates me as the most competent candidate for the position. First, let me make it clear, I am more excited than I have ever been to potentially work with the team. Second, there's nothing more that one could ask out of life than
teach students at the university level. 

My philosophy was originally based on some of the more popular techniques like focus groups and debating after reading a few books on teaching. However, I learned over time,
both teaching and tutoring students, that I achieve better results when I am adaptive to class needs. Students MUST be included in every presentation or piece of work that
is addressed to them. So, while I do make sure to cover class specifics such as relation extraction in Natural Language Processing or queues in Data Structures, I also add
in other cues to help students focus. In today's mobile world, it's very important to make your class interactive and easy-to-understand. 
I always try to encourage those that want to help and discourage unethical means of work. In general, this leads to an amazing outcome -- happy students with CS backgrounds
that are ready to apply their knowledge in the real world. 
Ten years ago I decided to dedicate my life to my passion -- Computational Linguistics. There is nothing more in this world that I would like to do than pass on my knowledge
from academia and the private sector to others so that they can succeed. I have attempted to narrow down my teaching focus for the optimum results to the ten points below.
